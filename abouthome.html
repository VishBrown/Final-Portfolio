        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>With a passion for technology and innovation, I am a driven Product Manager with a rich background in electronics and communication engineering from PES University and a masterâ€™s degree in Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship from Brown University. My diverse academic and professional journey includes cross-registering at Harvard University to delve deeper into Systems Development for Computational Science.</p>
            <p>My experience spans a wide array of roles and industries, each contributing uniquely to my skill set and approach to product management. At CompScience, I spearheaded the design and implementation of critical data management processes, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of Loss Run data applications. This role also saw me taking charge of a Customer Success Platform, directly addressing and resolving onboarding challenges to significantly improve user experience.</p>
            <p>Prior to this, at Playsimple Games in Bangalore, I owned and refined a central analytics tool used across business units, which was instrumental in providing actionable insights and driving key business decisions. My approach emphasized a user-experience-centric strategy and design thinking, which notably reduced rework time by 53% and improved productivity by 47% through optimized scrum sprints. My leadership in roadmap planning and strategy alignment resulted in an 80% reduction in planning time, allowing more focus on execution and innovation.</p>
            <p>My technical skills are grounded in software engineering with proficiency in SQL, Python, C++, and several project management tools like JIRA and Figma. My capability to blend technical expertise with market insights allows me to lead and motivate large teams, ensuring stakeholder alignment and delivering products that resonate well with users.</p>
