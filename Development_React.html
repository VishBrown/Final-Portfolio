        <h1>Competitor Analysis and React Application</h1>

        <div class="introduction">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>As a part of a UI/UX course at Brown I performed competitive analysis and built a react app</p>
            <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice conducting competitive analysis between competitor companies and learn how to identify strengths and weaknesses in design elements employed by industry designers.</li>
                <li>Create a functional aggregator interface using React and practice using a reactive framework for frontend development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to develop an interactive interface, use interface components, and tie the components to an internal data state. Create a list-based interface which can sort and filter! For this exercise, I've used an online shopping platform for books where you can sort the items, then add them to the cart.</p>

            <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <p>I analyzed the favoriting functions across Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and ThriftBooks to identify differences in user engagement and convenience. Here are my findings:</p>

            <h2 class="center-bold smaller-heading">Summary of Discoveries</h2> 
            <p>Amazon offers extensive personalization and convenience with Alexa compatibility and customizable favorite lists. Barnes & Noble simplifies the process of adding items to favorites directly from the landing page. ThriftBooks allows customization directly from the favorites list, offering a unique advantage in user experience. Inspired by these findings, my own list-based interface will feature direct favoriting from the landing page, advanced list customization, and voice command compatibility.</p>
            <p>Amazon stood out to me because of its modern features, such as Alexa compatibility and the ability to search and customize favorite lists extensively. From my research, Amazon offers users the functionality to tailor their shopping experience to their personal needs.</p>
            <p>Barnes & Noble also has a unique feature: it allows users to add their items to favorites directly from the landing page. The user can thus add things to their favorites easily. However, it falls short in areas like a voice companion and modular functionalities within the list. This indicates that there is possible room for improvement.</p>
            <p>The biggest advantage of ThriftBooks is the ability to customize book formats directly from the favorites list. Users can add what type of cover they want and how worn out the book should be. However, the list is not easily traversable and it’s unintuitive when it comes to adding an item to the favorites list.</p>
            <h2 class="center-bold smaller-heading">Implementing My Own List-Based Interface</h2>
            <p>After collecting thoughts on these web pages, I prioritized a mix of features from these webpages for my own List-based interface:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Favoriting from Landing Page:</strong> Inspired by Barnes & Noble, this feature would simplify the process of marking items, making the interface more user-friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced List Customization:</strong> Drawing from Amazon, allowing users to create multiple, customizable lists to organize their interests or shopping plans efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Search and sort Within Favorites:</strong> Implementing a search and sort function within favorites, as seen in Amazon, to enable users to quickly locate specific items in potentially extensive lists.</li>
                <li><strong>Format Customization in Favorites:</strong> Borrowing from ThriftBooks, this feature would allow users to choose and change formats (e.g., paperback, hardcover) for books directly within their lists, catering to personal preferences without navigating away from the list.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice Command Compatibility:</strong> Leveraging technology akin to Amazon’s Alexa, enabling users to interact with their lists hands-free, adding another layer of convenience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>React App</h1>
            <p>To better understand aggregators, filters, and sorts, I spent time developing a React application. This application takes the user to Vishak's bookstore and allows the user to browse, filter and sort book selections. The user can the add desired items to a cart which shows them the list of selections along with the total number and price of the items they selected.<p>
